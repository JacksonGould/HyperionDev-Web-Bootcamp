// Optional Bonus Task:

Prompt user to input a number

Store input in variable "n"

If "n" is less than 10 and is 1,4,6,8, 9

Or "n" is greater than 9 and ends with 0,2,4, 5 ,6, 8

	Output "Not Prime"


Else add digits of "n" together and store result in variable "sum"

	If "sum" can divide by 3

	Output "Not Prime"


Else calculate square root of "n"

Store square root in variable "root"

	// I'm aware that this is where my algorithm breaks down

Determine all prime numbers below value of "root"	

	If "root" can be divided by prime number below "root"

		Output "Not Prime"

	Else

		Output "Prime"
